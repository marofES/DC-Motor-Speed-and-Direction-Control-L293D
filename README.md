# DC-Motor-Speed-and-Direction-Control-L293D
The whole process of how to DC motor controls speed through Arduino and L293D. Simulations have been done in Proteus.  The Arduino generates control signals based on the input from the variable resistor but the motor can not process them directly so we are using an L293D motor driver. The speed of the DC motor (both directions) is controlled with the 10k potentiometer which is connected to analog channel 0 (A0).  The direction of rotation is controlled with the push button which is connected to pin 13 and pin 12 of the Arduino UNO board. If button1 means pin13 is pressed the motor will move clockwise and if button2 means pin12 is pressed the motor will move anti-clockwise.  The L293D driver has 2 VCCs: VCC1 is +5V and VCC2 is +12V. Pins IN1 and IN2 are the control pins where connected to pin 11 and pin 10 of the Arduino UNO board.
